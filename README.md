# Traffic & Pedestrian Monitoring System Using YOLOv8

This project is a real-time traffic and pedestrian monitoring system that uses **YOLOv8** for object detection. It can detect vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians in a video, display counts of each category, and highlight congestion when the number of detected objects exceeds a threshold.

## Features

- Detects multiple vehicle types: car, bus, truck, motorbike, bicycle.
- Detects pedestrians.
- Displays default YOLO bounding boxes and labels.
- Counts the number of each detected object in real-time.
- Displays a "Congestion Detected" warning when the total number of objects exceeds 10.
- Works on pre-recorded video files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://pypi.org/project/ultralytics/)
- OpenCV (`cv2`)

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python

Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-pedestrian-monitor.git
cd traffic-pedestrian-monitor
Place your video file in the project folder.

Run the script:
Video Example
The system uses YOLOv8â€™s default bounding boxes and labels for clear visualization of detected objects.

Notes
The congestion threshold is currently set to 10 objects. You can change it in the script:

if total_detected > 10:
    cv2.putText(annotated_frame, "Congestion Detected", (x, y),
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 0, 255), 2)
This project uses YOLOv8-nano (yolov8n.pt) for faster processing. You can switch to larger models for higher accuracy.
